# Find Frequent ItemSet With Multiple Item Support

This project is a Data Mining project wherein Association Rules between 2 objects such as bread, butter can be inferred. If a person buys {bread, butter} regularly then we can create an association rule like "bread -> butter". We have given a set of transactions as input and tried to infer the association rules between those objects using "Minimum Support Apriori Algorithm".

Each Item has it's own Minimum Item Support, so we have to take into consideration the difference between those items in an itemset, etc.

Please get back to us if you have any doubts in the implementation.
